### Hi there, I'm Brian - aka Klondike-the-Codiac
    Growing up engineering and technology were always passionate fascinations of mine. From a young age I always had to know how things worked and why they worked that way.  All through middle school and high school I did everything I could to steer and focus my studies towards any kind of engineering or technology I could get my hands on. From school projects like building my own circuits to participating in every program at local colleges that I could get accepted to attend I was absolutely fascinated with science and tech.  As we grow up, some get the pleasure of having responsibilities grow faster than others and that was the case for me when my son was born and life and bills took center stage over my other passions.  Now that my life is more stable and both of my children are a bit older, I’m ecstatic to be pursuing my love for how things work, through the deeply fascinating world of computer science!
